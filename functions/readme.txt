 **********************************************************************/
My collage is a merger of the solfege (do re mi fa so la ti do)
and sped up. Then mixed with a  2-times looped paino sound, ampliefied,
mixed with its reverse, before applying a hiphop then fade effect.
The final audio is then clamped within the required limits

None of the sound effects were surprising as I had a good intuition of how
each effect will contribute to the overall sound.

The resulting sound is however neither pleasant nor smooth thanks to my poor
intuition with sound, zero music talent and no experience with
instruments.

Howeve, the sound effects work quite well, especially with only one sound
sample that is mixed, merged and modified in any number ways.
